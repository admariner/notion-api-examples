- This repository contains a series of API examples using Notion's official public JavaScript client found at https://github.com/makenotion/notion-sdk-js.
- We'll aim to cover most of the endpoints, including some API endpoints that are enterprise only (namely the SCIM API, examples of which are found in examples/scim).
- You'll use JavaScript and attempt to extract reusable components for accessing the APIs to the folder.
